Several supervised machine learning methods have been proposed in classifying numeric data into specified labels. However, classifying natural language,
comparatively, is less explored as it possesses complicated challenges such as reading language at the machine level. This paper investigates the efficacy of
using machine learning to categorize blogs. We design a text classification experiment to categorize blogs into three user groups: ‘teenage’, ‘adults’ and ‘mature’. Our
empirical findings indicate that leveraging machine learning models and the right feature vectorization can improve the content shown to users against randomly
selected ones.
